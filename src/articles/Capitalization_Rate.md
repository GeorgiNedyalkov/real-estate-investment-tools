# Capitalization Rate

## What is Capitalization Rate or CAP rate for short?

Capitalization rate is the _expected rate of return_ on a real estate investment property.

## How it is computed?

The cap rate represents the yield of a property over a one-year time horizon assuming the property is purchased on cash.

Capitalization Rate = Net Operating Income / Current Market Value

## What is the difference between a purchase cap rate and a pro-forma cap rate

The current market value. When purchasing prior to any imporvements the current value is the price you paid.
In Pro-forma cap rate the value of the property is the expected ARV (After repair/renovation value).

# Net Operating Income

Net operating income (NOI) is a calculation used to analyze the profitability of income-generating real estate investments. NOI equals all revenue from the property, minus all reasonably necessary operating expenses.

NOI is a before-tax figure, appearing on a property’s income and cash flow statement, that excludes principal and interest payments on loans, capital expenditures, depreciation, and amortization. When this metric is used in other industries, it is referred to as “EBIT,” which stands for “earnings before interest and taxes.”
